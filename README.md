# Yahtzee
A work in progress - hoping to end up building a kind of nice yahtzee framework and then try to implement some different yahtzee playing algorithms (maybe monte carlo, neural network, etc). Stemming from mid-yahtzee computing banter. It might be interesting to see the distribution of scores achieved by different algorithms, such as a greedy yahtzee-seeking algorithm, or a more measured greedy algorithm searching for intersections between dice and targets (maybe weighting by scores / ease). All sorts of fun opportunities are available - reading random integers from `/dev/urandom`, synchronizing different algorithms into one stream of dice of "game", implementing algorithms as generators that require sent variables, secure extra-algorithm move validation..
